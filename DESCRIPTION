Description: Compute bounds for the treatment effect 
    after adjusting for the presence of omitted variables in linear  
    econometric models, according to the method of Basu (2022) <arXiv:2203.12431>. 
    You supply the data, identify the outcome and 
    treatment variables and additional regressors. The main functions
    will compute bounds for the bias-adjusted treatment effect. Many
    plot functions allow easy visualization of results.
